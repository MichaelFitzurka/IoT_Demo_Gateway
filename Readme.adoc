== Purpose
This repository is part of a series of three, which in combination resemble an
Internet of Things ( IoT ) demo-environment, based on the 3-Layered architecture of

* https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Demo_Sensors[Edge / Sensors ( this )]: as created of data
* https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Demo_Gateway[Smart Gateway / Controller]: first level of data processing
* https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Demo_Datacenter[Datacenter]: well, the datacenter ...

These layers can - and in this demo will - be made out of a set of
Red Hat JBoss products, each taking over an important part in the IoT landscape

== Gateway
In your classical IoT architecture the Gateway can provide various capabilities, like

* local access point for sensors
* first aggregation point for sensor data
* "normalization" of sensor data
* forwarding sensor data to datacenter

With this much logic in the Gateway, it is more then fair to call it a "Smart Gateway"

== Architecture
=== Running on dedicated hardware
The Smart Gateway is build based on the following technologies

* Raspberry Pi V2 ( or any other similar hardware )
* Raspbian as the operating system for RPi
* Hypriot as Docker-Host products
* Apache ActiveMQ ( provided via https://developers.redhat.com/download-manager/file/jboss-amq-6.2.1.GA.zip[JBoss A-MQ] ) for MQTT and JMS messaging
* https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/softwareDownload.html?softwareId=41301[JBoss Fuse] running on https://developers.redhat.com/download-manager/file/jboss-eap-6.4.0.CVE-2015-7501.zip[JBoss EAP] for the required integration capabilities.

Installation instructions for a Smart Gateway can be found http://www.opensourcerers.org/building-a-rasperry-pi-based-smart-gateway-for-iot/[here] and for "lazy" people http://www.opensourcerers.org/building-the-iot-smart-gateway-for-the-lazy-ones-ansible-rules/[here].

=== Running in an "all in one" setup
